19/5
installed mysql, setup

20/5
set mysql root password
wrote sql/ scripts to load csv into mysql,
then group by minute

21/5
count + plot of 'quake' during nepal earthquake

22/5
met with andreas
	- use IDF (log tweets/hits) to count occurrences
	- make system which accepts terms and plots them
	- save results for a term as CSV
	- look at TOPSY, D3
finally, collect some 20 events with start time, etc
use existing techniques on same data and and compare results
find optimal parameters for these techniques (niagarino?)

26/5
JDBC - TweetCount
JFreeChart - timeseries, date formatting, etc

27/5
showed IDF, JFreeChart to Andreas
got papers to read
next- collect more events
introduction to Niagarino next week and then start
comparision of techniques
created event_tweet view to store tweets in a time range

28/5
lab meeting - Andreas' presentation for Caise Stockholm
wrote script for batch LOAD FILE in mysql
switched from event_tweet view to command line LOAD INFILE (scripts/load.sh)

1/6
setup niagarino
stop using scripts/cut.sh - load.sh can discard extra columns

2/6
fixed dateformat in EventDetector with Andreas
started running EventDetector on boston_bombing, etc
next -> batch run of detector for 
	- multiple inputs
	- parameters of techniques
	- all techniques

3/6

9/6
met Michael, asked about parameters to use
plot output as quality vs parameter
use parameter p/2, p, 2p
quality = f(precision, recall)
run eventdetector only for first 2 methods
added events - ontake eruption, afghan landslide


10/6
ran topN, shifty on all events and entered results

11/6
meeting - future work on basex by christian
found 1-hour early data files, started running on 
new files

15/6
added sydney_hostage event
ran watis, fullrandom, randomevents
changed edcow params - didnt find any events with previous ones

17/6
new edcow params worked! (1, 64, 2, 0.2)

18/6
added documentation to twitter-events-plot

22/6
started multiple event plotting

23/6
mostly finished multiple event plotting

24/6 
some more changes to multiple event plot, discussion with andreas of 
what to do next - IDF of words like love, twitter is almost constant over
time. IDF of event words drops during event. approaches -
	1. remove stopwords by using constant nature
	2. get event words by detecting step nature

25/6
discussion with andreas - technique for detection
detect stopwords - didnt find a way to do this
step detection for event words - already done
find std dev / mean of IDF and see if it can be used
to detect event (using R

28/6
wrote most of stddev.py - high stddev observed for non english tweets
todo - try this with english tweets

30/6
results of stddev.py on nepal_quake good - earthquake in top 10/20 stddev
nearly all other words with high stddev are non-english 
took english tweet data from mathew, run stddev on these
todo: try stddev method with only english tweets
